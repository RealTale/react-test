# React MobX React-Router Boilerplate
React, React-Router, MobX, MobX-Router and Webpack 2-boilerplate with async routes.

Just run `yarn` or `npm install` and `yarn start` or `npm start`, then go to localhost:1337 to start developing.
To build, run `yarn run build` or `npm run build`, and to preview run `yarn run preview` or `npm run preview`, then go
to localhost:3000 for the minified production bundle.

#### Async component loading
Components are now loaded async with react-router-loader and the store is injected via MobX Provider.
